# Project Overview

This project is a job application automation pipeline designed to help job seekers optimize their applications by automating the tedious tasks of:


1. Resume Validation â€“ Check if the resume is valid and well-structured.

2. Query Validation â€“ Validate and normalize job roles.

3. Resume Parsing â€“ Extract structured data from unstructured resumes.

4. Job Search â€“ Find relevant jobs based on a user-provided role.

5. Job Match Validation â€“ Analyze how well the resume matches the job descriptions.

6. Cover Letter Generation â€“ Generate a personalized cover letter for each job.

# Tech Stack

### Backend: FastAPI
 â€“ Fast and modern web framework for building APIs.

### Frontend: Streamlit
 â€“ Python framework for building interactive web applications.

**AI Models:** DeepAgent, LLMs (Large Language Models) â€“ Used for resume parsing, job matching, and cover letter generation.

### File Handling: tempfile
 â€“ Used to temporarily save uploaded files.

### Real-time Updates: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
 â€“ For real-time pipeline updates.

# Features

1. **Upload Resume (PDF):** Users can upload a resume and query a job role.

2. **Real-time Streaming:** Receive real-time updates for each step of the process.

3. **Job Matching:** AI analyzes how well the resume fits with relevant job openings.

4. **Cover Letter Generation:** Generate a personalized cover letter based on job matching.

5. **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

6. **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling and detailed feedback at each step of the pipeline.

# Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Virtual environment (recommended for isolating dependencies)

## Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

. git clone https://github.com/dharampatel/JobMatchPortal.git
. cd job-application-assistant


2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

. python -m venv venv
. source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
. venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows


3. **Install dependencies:**

. pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **Start the backend API with FastAPI:**

. uvicorn app.main:app --reload


5. **Start the Streamlit frontend:**

. streamlit run app/frontend.py

#### Ensure that the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend are both running before interacting with the app.

# Usage

1. **Upload Resume:** Choose a .pdf resume from your computer and upload it.

2. **Enter Job Query:** Type in the job title (or role) you're applying for.

3. **Submit:** Click "Submit" to start the process.

4. **Track Progress:** You will see real-time updates at each step, including:

. Resume validation

. Resume parsing

. Job search results

. Job match validation

. Cover letter generation

5. **Download Cover Letter:** Once the cover letter is generated, you can download it as a .txt file.

# API Documentation

**The FastAPI backend serves the following endpoints:**

. POST /apply/stream

**Request:**

. file: The uploaded resume in .pdf format.

. role: The job role (e.g., "Software Engineer").

**Response:**

. Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming updates at each stage of the pipeline (resume validation, job search, job match, cover letter generation).

**Example:**

. POST http://localhost:8000/apply/stream

# Frontend

The Streamlit UI allows users to interact with the Job Application Assistant easily. It provides:

. A file uploader to upload the resume.

. A text input to enter the job role.

. A real-time streaming interface that updates step-by-step, showing progress and results.
